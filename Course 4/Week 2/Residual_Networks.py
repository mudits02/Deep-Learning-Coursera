# # Residual Networks
# 
# Welcome to the first assignment of this week! You'll be building a very deep convolutional network, using Residual Networks (ResNets). In theory, very deep networks can represent very complex functions; but in practice, they are hard to train. Residual Networks, introduced by [He et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), allow you to train much deeper networks than were previously feasible.
# 
# **By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:**
# 
# - Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets in a deep neural network using Keras
# - Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification
# - Implement a skip connection in your network
# 
# For this assignment, you'll use Keras.

# ## 2 - The Problem of Very Deep Neural Networks
# 
# Last week, you built your first convolutional neural networks: first manually with numpy, then using Tensorflow and Keras. 
# 
# In recent years, neural networks have become much deeper, with state-of-the-art networks evolving from having just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.
# 
# * The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output). 
# 
# * However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow.
# 
# * More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and "explode," from gaining very large values). 
# 
# * During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the gradient for the shallower layers decrease to zero very rapidly as training proceeds, as shown below: 

# <img src="images/vanishing_grad_kiank.png" style="width:450px;height:220px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 1</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Vanishing gradient</b> <br> The speed of learning decreases very rapidly for the shallower layers as the network trains </center></caption>
# 
# Not to worry! You are now going to solve this problem by building a Residual Network!

# <a name='3'></a>
# ## 3 - Building a Residual Network
# 
# In ResNets, a "shortcut" or a "skip connection" allows the model to skip layers:  
# 
# <img src="images/skip_connection_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:200px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 2</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : A ResNet block showing a skip-connection <br> </center></caption>
# 
# The image on the left shows the "main path" through the network. The image on the right adds a shortcut to the main path. By stacking these ResNet blocks on top of each other, you can form a very deep network. 
# 
# The lecture mentioned that having ResNet blocks with the shortcut also makes it very easy for one of the blocks to learn an identity function. This means that you can stack on additional ResNet blocks with little risk of harming training set performance.  
#     
# On that note, there is also some evidence that the ease of learning an identity function accounts for ResNets' remarkable performance even more than skip connections help with vanishing gradients.
# 
# Two main types of blocks are used in a ResNet, depending mainly on whether the input/output dimensions are the same or different. You are going to implement both of them: the "identity block" and the "convolutional block."

# <a name='3-1'></a>
# ### 3.1 - The Identity Block
# 
# The identity block is the standard block used in ResNets, and corresponds to the case where the input activation (say $a^{[l]}$) has the same dimension as the output activation (say $a^{[l+2]}$). To flesh out the different steps of what happens in a ResNet's identity block, here is an alternative diagram showing the individual steps:
# 
# <img src="images/idblock2_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:150px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 3</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Identity block.</b> Skip connection "skips over" 2 layers. </center></caption>
# 
# The upper path is the "shortcut path." The lower path is the "main path." In this diagram, notice the CONV2D and ReLU steps in each layer. To speed up training, a BatchNorm step has been added. Don't worry about this being complicated to implement--you'll see that BatchNorm is just one line of code in Keras! 
# 
# In this exercise, you'll actually implement a slightly more powerful version of this identity block, in which the skip connection "skips over" 3 hidden layers rather than 2 layers. It looks like this: 
# 
# <img src="images/idblock3_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:150px;">
#     <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 4</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Identity block.</b> Skip connection "skips over" 3 layers.</center></caption>

# These are the individual steps:
# 
# First component of main path: 
# - The first CONV2D has $F_1$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid". Use 0 as the seed for the random uniform initialization: `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`. 
# - The first BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.
# - Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no hyperparameters. 
# 
# Second component of main path:
# - The second CONV2D has $F_2$ filters of shape $(f,f)$ and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "same". Use 0 as the seed for the random uniform initialization: `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`.
# - The second BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.
# - Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no hyperparameters.
# 
# Third component of main path:
# - The third CONV2D has $F_3$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid". Use 0 as the seed for the random uniform initialization: `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`. 
# - The third BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.
# - Note that there is **no** ReLU activation function in this component. 
# 
# Final step: 
# - The `X_shortcut` and the output from the 3rd layer `X` are added together.
# - **Hint**: The syntax will look something like `Add()([var1,var2])`
# - Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no hyperparameters. 
# 
# <a name='ex-1'></a>
# ### Exercise 1 - identity_block
# 
# Implement the ResNet identity block. The first component of the main path has been implemented for you already! First, you should read these docs carefully to make sure you understand what's happening. Then, implement the rest. 
# - To implement the Conv2D step: [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D)
# - To implement BatchNorm: [BatchNormalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) `BatchNormalization(axis = 3)(X, training = training)`. If training is set to False, its weights are not updated with the new examples. I.e when the model is used in prediction mode.
# - For the activation, use:  `Activation('relu')(X)`
# - To add the value passed forward by the shortcut: [Add](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Add)
# 
# We have added the initializer argument to our functions. This parameter receives an initializer function like the ones included in the package [tensorflow.keras.initializers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers) or any other custom initializer. By default it will be set to [random_uniform](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers/RandomUniform)
# 
# Remember that these functions accept a `seed` argument that can be any value you want, but that in this notebook must set to 0 for **grading purposes**.

#  Here is where you're actually using the power of the Functional API to create a shortcut path:

# ### 3.2 - The Convolutional Block
# 
# The ResNet "convolutional block" is the second block type. You can use this type of block when the input and output dimensions don't match up. The difference with the identity block is that there is a CONV2D layer in the shortcut path: 
# 
# <img src="images/convblock_kiank.png" style="width:650px;height:150px;">
# <caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 4</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Convolutional block</b> </center></caption>
# 
# * The CONV2D layer in the shortcut path is used to resize the input $x$ to a different dimension, so that the dimensions match up in the final addition needed to add the shortcut value back to the main path. (This plays a similar role as the matrix $W_s$ discussed in lecture.) 
# * For example, to reduce the activation dimensions's height and width by a factor of 2, you can use a 1x1 convolution with a stride of 2. 
# * The CONV2D layer on the shortcut path does not use any non-linear activation function. Its main role is to just apply a (learned) linear function that reduces the dimension of the input, so that the dimensions match up for the later addition step. 
# * As for the previous exercise, the additional `initializer` argument is required for grading purposes, and it has been set by default to [glorot_uniform](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers/GlorotUniform)
# 
# The details of the convolutional block are as follows. 
# 
# First component of main path:
# - The first CONV2D has $F_1$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is "valid". Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`.
# - The first BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.
# - Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no hyperparameters. 
# 
# Second component of main path:
# - The second CONV2D has $F_2$ filters of shape (f,f) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "same".  Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`.
# - The second BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis.
# - Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no hyperparameters. 
# 
# Third component of main path:
# - The third CONV2D has $F_3$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (1,1). Its padding is "valid".  Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`.
# - The third BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis. Note that there is no ReLU activation function in this component. 
# 
# Shortcut path:
# - The CONV2D has $F_3$ filters of shape (1,1) and a stride of (s,s). Its padding is "valid".  Use 0 as the `glorot_uniform` seed `kernel_initializer = initializer(seed=0)`.
# - The BatchNorm is normalizing the 'channels' axis. 
# 
# Final step: 
# - The shortcut and the main path values are added together.
# - Then apply the ReLU activation function. This has no hyperparameters. 
#  
# <a name='ex-2'></a>    
# ### Exercise 2 - convolutional_block
#     
# Implement the convolutional block. The first component of the main path is already implemented; then it's your turn to implement the rest! As before, always use 0 as the seed for the random initialization, to ensure consistency with the grader.
# - [Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D)
# - [BatchNormalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) (axis: Integer, the axis that should be normalized (typically the features axis)) `BatchNormalization(axis = 3)(X, training = training)`. If training is set to False, its weights are not updated with the new examples. I.e when the model is used in prediction mode.
# - For the activation, use:  `Activation('relu')(X)`

# For the purposes of this assignment, you've been asked to train the model for ten epochs. You can see that it performs well. The online grader will only run your code for a small number of epochs as well. Please go ahead and submit your assignment. 

# After you have finished this official (graded) part of this assignment, you can also optionally train the ResNet for more iterations, if you want. It tends to get much better performance when trained for ~20 epochs, but this does take more than an hour when training on a CPU. 
# 
# Using a GPU, this ResNet50 model's weights were trained on the SIGNS dataset. You can load and run the trained model on the test set in the cells below. It may take ≈1min to load the model. Have fun!

# **Congratulations** on finishing this assignment! You've now implemented a state-of-the-art image classification system! Woo hoo! 
# 
# ResNet50 is a powerful model for image classification when it's trained for an adequate number of iterations. Hopefully, from this point, you can use what you've learned and apply it to your own classification problem to perform state-of-the-art accuracy.

# <font color = 'blue'>
# 
# **What you should remember**:
# 
# - Very deep "plain" networks don't work in practice because vanishing gradients make them hard to train.  
# - Skip connections help address the Vanishing Gradient problem. They also make it easy for a ResNet block to learn an identity function. 
# - There are two main types of blocks: The **identity block** and the **convolutional block**. 
# - Very deep Residual Networks are built by stacking these blocks together.

# ## 5 - Test on Your Own Image (Optional/Ungraded)

# If you wish, you can also take a picture of your own hand and see the output of the model. To do this:
#     1. Click on "File" in the upper bar of this notebook, then click "Open" to go on your Coursera Hub.
#     2. Add your image to this Jupyter Notebook's directory, in the "images" folder
#     3. Write your image's name in the following code
#     4. Run the code and check if the algorithm is right! 

# In[ ]:


img_path = 'images/my_image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(64, 64))
x = image.img_to_array(img)
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
x = x/255.0
print('Input image shape:', x.shape)
imshow(img)
prediction = pre_trained_model.predict(x)
print("Class prediction vector [p(0), p(1), p(2), p(3), p(4), p(5)] = ", prediction)
print("Class:", np.argmax(prediction))


# Even though the model has high accuracy, it might be performing poorly on your own set of images. Notice that, the shape of the pictures, the lighting where the photos were taken, and all of the preprocessing steps can have an impact on the performance of the model. Considering everything you have learned in this specialization so far, what do you think might be the cause here?
# 
# *Hint*: It might be related to some distributions. Can you come up with a potential solution ?

# You can also print a summary of your model by running the following code.
